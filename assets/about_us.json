      "details": "In a world where everything keeps changing, the only thing that remains constant in our life is our family. It is natural to put our family first before anything else. Being present for them in times of need and making sure they are not alone should be our priority. But unfortunately most of us do not have this luxury. Our busy work schedules leave us with no time for our dear ones and therefore we fall short of our commitments. And even when it comes to our own-selves, it is the same since we are deprived of time. Seeing our loved ones struggle in times of crises can be traumatizing, especially when we are out of reach for them. Crises come in different forms and fear grips us when it is in the form of an HEALTH ISSUE or a MEDICAL EMERGENCY. When in fear we can neither fight nor fly and this can result in a harrowing experience for us and our family. You and your dear ones deserve more than this fear. You deserve to be empowered, to be secured and to be protected. You need someone who can do that for you. You need someone who can take the role of an extended family member and do what is supposed to be done as a family. Being WELL-PREPARED is the only mantra and that mantra is Udhaivi. "
